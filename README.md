# The Green Knight
-Developed in Unity<br />
-In a fantastical world, a small frog warrior known as the Green Knight must travel on a perilous quest, hoping to redeem himself after being banished over a terrible mistake.<br />
-Single-Player PvE Experience<br />
-Players control the Green Knight, going through small, isolated areas where they fight enemies, solve puzzles, and accomplish other tasks to progress to the next level.<br />
-Isometric camera rotates around cube-like worlds, allowing players to look from different angles and find secrets & routes.<br />
-Players gather new equipment and increased stats to grow in strength as they progress.<br />
-Combat & puzzles are relatively simple; players are expected to quickly progress from level to level.<br />
-The primary demographic of players we are aiming for are the achievers.<br />
-The type of players that enjoy completing levels, gaining new equipment, growing their stats, and who enjoy beating the game as completely as possible.<br />
-We plan on delivering a level demonstrating the core aspects of the game and its general gameplay loop.<br />
-In it, players will be able to walk around, fight enemies, and interact with a simple lock-and-key puzzle at the levelâ€™s end, all in a small cube-esque area with a rotating camera controlled by the player.<br />
