# The Green Knight
Developed in Unity\n\n
\nIn a fantastical world, a small frog warrior known as the Green Knight must travel on a perilous quest, hoping to redeem himself after being banished over a terrible mistake.
Single-Player PvE Experience
Players control the Green Knight, going through small, isolated areas where they fight enemies, solve puzzles, and accomplish other tasks to progress to the next level.
Isometric camera rotates around cube-like worlds, allowing players to look from different angles and find secrets & routes.
Players gather new equipment and increased stats to grow in strength as they progress.
Combat & puzzles are relatively simple; players are expected to quickly progress from level to level.
The primary demographic of players we are aiming for are the achievers.
The type of players that enjoy completing levels, gaining new equipment, growing their stats, and who enjoy beating the game as completely as possible.
We plan on delivering a level demonstrating the core aspects of the game and its general gameplay loop.
In it, players will be able to walk around, fight enemies, and interact with a simple lock-and-key puzzle at the levelâ€™s end, all in a small cube-esque area with a rotating camera controlled by the player.
